# 🍷 Red Wine Quality Analysis – Economics Research Project

**Project Title:** Which Chemical Components of Red Wine Influence the Caliber of the Wine?  
**Institution:** Florida International University (FIU)  
**Course:** ECO 4421 – Introduction to Econometrics  
**Term:** Fall 2020  
**Dataset:** 1,599 observations of Portuguese red wine samples  
**Tools:** Excel, R (or Python), Econometric modeling

## 📌 Overview

This research project explored which chemical properties of red wine most strongly influence its sensory quality ratings. Using a dataset of 1,599 red wine samples from Portugal, we ran regression analyses to identify which chemical elements (e.g., alcohol, acidity, sulfates) most significantly affected wine quality. The study aimed to connect chemical composition with perceived quality to provide insight for both economic producers and consumers.

## 📊 Methodology

- Performed multiple regression analysis using quantitative variables such as:
  - Alcohol content
  - Volatile acidity
  - Sulphates
  - Citric acid
  - pH level
  - Residual sugar
- Evaluated the **statistical significance (p-values)** and **coefficient strength** to rank the impact of each chemical component on wine quality
- Used the **winequality-red.csv** dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Alcohol content** was found to be the **most statistically significant predictor** of wine quality
- Volatile acidity showed a **negative relationship** with wine quality—higher acidity lowered the score
- Sulphates and citric acid showed **positive but less dominant effects**
- Multicollinearity checks and residual analysis confirmed model assumptions were reasonably met

## 📈 Business & Economic Implications

- For winemakers: Increasing alcohol content within reason may improve sensory ratings and market perception
- For economists and industry analysts: Understanding sensory predictors may guide **consumer pricing models** and **product segmentation**
- For data scientists: This dataset demonstrates the use of econometric modeling to **quantify subjective quality** using objective chemical metrics

## 💡 Lessons & Reflections

This project gave me early exposure to using regression modeling and econometric tools to answer real-world quality and market questions. It built my foundation in hypothesis testing, variable selection, and interpreting model output for strategic recommendations—skills I’ve since refined and scaled in my MBA and Amazon analytics work.
