# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashlynn Maddox

Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm an Operations Strategy & Analytics leader with 4+ years of experience at Amazon, where I've led global initiatives that delivered over $18M in business impact. My work bridges strategy, data analysis, and cross-functional execution spanning supply chain optimization, process improvement, and internal product development.

I'm currently pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics and hold a BA in Economics, where I’ve conducted research on topics ranging from wine quality economics to data visualization for operational KPIs.

This portfolio showcases selected non-sensitive projects across my academic and professional journey.

## 🛠️ What I Built

To simulate a real-world analytics scenario similar to how a company like Amazon might investigate and reduce logistics inefficiencies. I designed a data-driven pipeline that starts with a Snowflake data warehouse and ends with an interactive dashboard built in Streamlit.

### 🔗 Data Architecture
I created a SQL-based data warehouse centered around a jam_data table, and connected it with multiple supporting tables, including:

- **repair_types** – classifying response and repair categories
- **weather_disruptions** – identifying weather-related impact on operations
- **jam_costs** – estimating the financial impact of each jam
- **repair_costs** – quantifying the cost of operational fixes


Additional informative tables to enrich analysis and enable cross-functional insights
This structure mimics what an enterprise data lake or warehouse might look like in a logistics-heavy organization.

🧠 Analytical Approach
Using SQL within Snowflake, I analyzed the relationships between jam frequency, cost, disruption causes, and repair outcomes. I developed case-based logic and calculated KPIs that reflect:

- Jam severity and cost
- High-frequency disruption types
- Geographic or temporal trends in occurrences
- Repair effectiveness and cost-efficiency
- 📊 Visualization & Strategic Insight

With the cleaned and joined data, I built an interactive Streamlit dashboard to:

- Visualize operational bottlenecks and disruption trends
- Highlight cost-intensive jams
- Provide actionable insights for reducing future incidents
- Serve as a consulting-style tool for strategy presentations

 to support business decisions and operational strategy.
