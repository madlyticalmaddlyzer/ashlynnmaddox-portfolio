# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashlynn Maddox

Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm an Operations Strategy & Analytics leader with 4+ years of experience at Amazon, where I've led global initiatives that delivered over $18M in business impact. My work bridges strategy, data analysis, and cross-functional execution spanning supply chain optimization, process improvement, and internal product development.

I'm currently pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics and hold a BA in Economics, where I’ve conducted research on topics ranging from wine quality economics to data visualization for operational KPIs.

This portfolio showcases selected non-sensitive projects across my academic and professional journey.
