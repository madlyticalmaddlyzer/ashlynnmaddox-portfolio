## 📌 Overview

As part of Amazon’s Global Logistics division, I co-led the creation and scaling of the Global Asset Lifecycle Program, focused on optimizing how critical Material Handling Equipment (MHE) assets were tracked, rebuilt, and managed across North America and the EU. My work helped transform how Amazon forecasted labor, managed procurement, and reduced equipment-related costs across fulfillment centers.

## 💡 Lessons & Reflections

This program sharpened my ability to operate across technical, procurement, and operational functions. I learned to balance short-term rebuild execution with long-term lifecycle planning, while leading key efforts to improve scalability, documentation, and internal tooling. The result was a global, data-driven asset strategy adopted across regions.
